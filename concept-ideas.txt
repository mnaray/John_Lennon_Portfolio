In this file i will write down all the ideas I get for this project

Buttons:
When hovering over a button, it should fill with a fitting (to linked url) color from left to right.
The animation I thought of is called Bounce To Right or Sweep To Right.

Logo:
When hovering over the logo, the letters should turn a bit
Sadly i didn't find an animation for this

When hovering over the logo, it should get underlined
The animation I though of is called Underline From Center
